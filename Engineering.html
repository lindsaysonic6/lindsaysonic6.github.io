                <p>Or an engineering major to be exact. For the first two years of my college experience, I was a Biomedical Engineering (BME) major at Georgia Tech. While I admire the craft, engineering just was not for me. During our projects, I always found myself drifting towards the design and writing portions over the math and hard science portions. I love the creativity of brainstorming and sketching solutions, so eventually I came to the decision to follow what I love and packed up bags and moved over to Computational Media. However, I still learned a plethora of valuable skills during my time in BMED.</p>
                <br>
                <p> Here’s a quick rundown:</p>
                <br>
                <h3> <strong>BMED 2310: </strong> Redesigning Nasal Cannulas to Improve Patient Experience</h3>
                <ul class="BMED2310">
                    <li> Proficient understanding of product design including researching a physiological problem and competitor devices on the market, interviewing users to find and prioritize their needs, modelling the device through SolidWorks, and building and testing prototypes under FDA regulations</li>
                    <br>
                    <li> Basic comprehension of the physiological impact of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease on the respiratory system and the mechanics of the oxygen therapy used to treat it</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <h3> <strong>BMED 2250: </strong>Repurposing a Flex Sensor to Characterize Knee Osteoarthritis Through Knee Flexion Angles </h3>
                <ul class="BMED2250">
                    <li> Proficient understanding of the process behind identifying key physiological needs, mathematically modelling tendons as springs, hardwiring a device, and preparing a testing protocol to measure the specificity, sensitivity, and p-values of related variables using ANOVA and MATLAB</li>
                    <br>
                    <li> Basic comprehension of knee kinematics and osteoarthritis’ effects on the pathology of the knee and overall gait</li>
                    <br>
                    <li> Ability to develop psychological safety and effective communication with team to increase team productivity</li>
                </ul>
