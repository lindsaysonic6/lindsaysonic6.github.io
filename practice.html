                <p>Hi, my name is Lindsay Rogers, and I’m currently a third-year Computational Media major at the Georgia Institute of Technology! I’ve got a passion for art and virtual media entertainment with an end goal of becoming the showrunner of my own cartoon at DreamWorks Animation Studios or Cartoon Network.</p>
                <p>Beyond drawing, in my free time, I love writing analyses on movies and books. In high school, I was trained to analyze fictional works with a critical eye, and this has shaped how I interact and plan out my own creative works. If I’m not watching or reading a fictional piece, catch me scavenging through history books as I am a big believer that we must understand history through multiple historiographies to improve our future.   </p>
                <p>I’ve also dedicated a large portion of my college experience to the Arts and Culture Committee on the Student Center Programs Council. For my time on this committee, I’ve focused on providing the necessary tools need to inspire a tech-focused university to get back in touch with their creative roots. Everyone has a story to tell and I love to help them ignite it! And it’s this sediment that guides my future goal of creating my own cartoon to inspire other to understand themselves better.</p>
                
                <p>One <b>fun fact</b> for the road: I performed a Dora the Explorer skit in front of 3,000 people while wearing a trash bag at an International competition (Future Problem Solving to be exact), so don’t say I’m never willing to get down and dirty to uplift my team!</p>
